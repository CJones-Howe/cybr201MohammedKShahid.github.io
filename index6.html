	<p>Plastic pollution is a major threat to marine wild life around the globe. Many animals, like sea turtles, fish, and dolphins often mistake pieces of plastic drifting in the ocean as food. This can cause them to have blockages in their digestive systems, malnutrition, and sometimes death. Also, marine life can become trapped in plastic waste, like fishing nets and plastic bags. This can lead to restriced bodily movements and possible strangulation. The continued plastic pollution of the ocean does not only harm indidivual animals, but whole marine ecosystems.</p>
